# Music Generation Project

This project focuses on generating music using an LSTM network trained on MIDI files. It utilizes the TensorFlow and music21 libraries for deep learning and music processing tasks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ArchitJambhule1011/Music_generation.git


2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install requirements.txt

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

- The `Data/` directory contains the MIDI files used for training and generating music.
- The `model/` directory includes the model implementation and related functions.
- The `src/` directory contains additional source files and functions.
- The `requirements.txt` file lists the project dependencies.
- The `model_file.h5` file stores the trained model.
- The `pred_music.mid` file is the generated music pattern.


### Usage

Run the main.py file to listen to the music composed by the LSTM model.
